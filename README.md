#   ManageBac / OpenApply to Gsheets

Interacts with the ManageBac and OpenApply APIs, downloading data into a Google Spreadsheet.

Particularly useful for using as a data source with Google Data Studio.

## Getting started

Note that you need access to API manager for this to work. Simplest way is to:

- Make a [copy of this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uc___fcVkp_QURp_9sMq3vFJSVncv2-ENwiZmVzz4bg/copy)
- Click on "Tools" and go to "Script Editor"
- Fill out the global variables in `Globals.gs` as appropriate
- Run the functions for `ManageBac.gs` and `OpenApply.gs` as appropriate
  - A function that runs "incremental" means that it only updates since last run (either full or incremental run)
  - A function that runs "full" is the opposite of "incremental" -- it downloads without any date filtering
  - The first time you run it, you have to run a full update (you have to start somewhere)
- Wait for them to finish

Note that a full update is doing quite a lot of work. While steps are taken to ensure it doesn't overwhelm servers, constantly running a full update of all your data may not be the nicest thing to do to the servers on the other side. :)

## Update to latest version

Instructions for updating to the latest version of the codebase from an old spreadsheet. In the attached project:

1. Bump the version for the MB_OA_Gsheets library to the latest.
2. Copy the code in `shell/*` and replace it with the files and code. For example, copy the contents of `shell/Managebac.js` to the `ManageBac.gs` file in the project



## How it works

It reads the data from the API, and puts an individual in each column, the fields across the top in columns. Since these APIs (or really any APIs) can have a nested structure, we have to flatten the field names with dot notation. So, for example, the OpenApply API has `custom_fields` field, which has nested fields `health_information`, so the field can name itself `custom_fields.health_information`. 

Brackets are used to indicate which number in the list it appears. So students with `parent_ids`, the column names will be `parent_ids[0]` for the first, `parent_ids[1]` for the second, and so on.

If a new row appears in the data, it'll add to the bottom. If additional columns are needed, they will be tacked on to the right of the existing columns. 

When it saves the data to the spreadsheet, it uses Google's very cool "Developer Metadata" API so that the project can track the location of each cell. Moving columns or rows around will track, even after being updated.

## Usage

Once you have the data in a spreadsheet, you can rearrange the columns, add header row, or add your own custom columns (for "notes" for example). Subsequent updates (either full or incremental) will track. 

You can also use it as a source for Google Data Studio, see [example](https://github.com/classroomtechtools/managebac_openapply_to_gsheets/blob/main/examples/DataStudio.md) for further details.

You can set up triggers to run. The author suggests having the full updates run once a week, and the incremental ones run once every few hours. (Incremental updates are not available on every endpoint, but where available take up far less than bandwidth and do not overwhelm servers with requests.)

For a detailed examples, see the examples folder in the code listing.

## Limitations

Developer Metadata has somewhat of a low quota. Exactly where you will see this limitation, however, depends on how much data you ask it to download. If you need all of the custom fields of OpenApply, for example, you will reach it much faster. However, if you are only getting enrolled students, and not withdrawn / declined students, you'll not likely approach the quota â€¦ unless the number of enrolled students is high. 

How high? Hard to tell without being more specific:

Developer Metadata is subject to (at the time of writing) `30,000` characters per sheet. Each row uses `6` characters (for the ID) and each column about `15` (depending on how many character the name of the header is), so 100 rows with 100 columns per entry will count for `(15 * 100 * 100 + 6 * 100) / 30000` or about `~50%` against the quota. Datasets that have more columns with large number of entries will use up the quota faster.

If this limitation is hit, you will get an error output with "cannot write as this would exceed quota limitations."

## Notes

### Authentication

- The ManageBac auth token is available from the Develop -> API Manager agrea.
- The OpenApply client ID and client secret can retrieved from the API Manager

The ManageBac tokens have permissions associated with them; be sure that the ones you need are enabled. If the token your using doesn't have permission to do something, it'll tell you!

### Data privacy

Remember, the data you are downloading to the spreadsheet should be **restricted** to only those individuals on your domain who need it. Don't turn on link sharing, for example. 

There is a feature `protectData` in case you need it. Perhaps you want to show a colleague how you built it? Don't share the real data, run a full update with `protectData: true` and safely share.

### Privacy Policy of this library

While you are providing authentication credentials to the library, these items are not saved in any way. They are simply passed through to the API requests themselves.

This library does not save any user data on any server or database. It only passes the information obtained from the API and stores it onto the attached spreadsheet.

### How is this so fast?

Anyone who has worked with APIs and AppsScripts may have found downloading lots of data to be a bit slow.

The code takes advantage of `UrlFetchApp.fetchAll` and a batch mode offereed in [this library](https://github.com/classroomtechtools/Endpoints) that very efficiently downloads as much as it can, while at the same time respecting the rate limitations. 

## Upgrading from previous versions

If you have a spreadsheet from an earlier version, you can update to the latest by bumping the version number of the library.
